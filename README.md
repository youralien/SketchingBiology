# SketchingBiology
Entering the wild of biological sketching for education and learning

# Studying Biology Videos in Khan Academcy

## Method
I started watching some [Biology videos on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/), starting with cell related topics. I wanted to understand what kinds of diagrams are being drawn, how are they used to illustrate concepts, and how does an instructor interact with a diagram.

## Observations

It is common to have one sketch that is a zoomed-in-version of a part of another sketch (e.g., Extra cellular matrix displayed with a couple cells, and a zoomed in picture of cell membrane and the things that connect a single cell to the matrix; A picture of the phospholipid bilayer, and then a diagram of a single phospholipid component).  

Spatial regions can be drawn on a zoomed in component, which could not be immediately reasoned based on the sketch (e.g., inside and outside of the cell is not so obvious, when we are only looking at a cross section of the membrane and inside is "below" and outside is "above").

Colors are used to depict different components, and though talking-aloud while drawing, instructors use colors, active arrow pointing, circling to label the entity they are talking about.
