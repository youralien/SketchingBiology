## personal skills

O: Harper and others did really good at collaborating across groups, and practicing the skill of coordinating a complicated system across 7 people. I loved how he acknowledges others contributions and talks.

A: I wondered why our group isn't using collaboration as heavily -- and especially myself.
1. our opportunity with Victor (who is my friend!), I think I've prioritized it as low and something I don't want to deal with, compared to learning about the analogy pipeline.
2. I know that the success of our project (as its defined now) is not requiring collaboration.
3. Early on, I have not nearly been as good as Mike who talks and messages many collaborators. Mike was great at synching up with Kezhen, other Cogsketch team members. And later on, setting up meetings with Kezhen to allow us to make progress. I haven't done any types of coordinated organizing, I think I started going to Maddie since she made herself available and I started to have a relationship with her.
